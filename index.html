Want to try yoga and meditation but donâ€™t know where to begin? Come explore the basics in a 
safe and welcoming environment with Michaela Shaw. Michaela has been sharing her love of 
yoga with the Toronto area community on a part-time and volunteer basis for almost 20 years 
and now resides full time in Gooderham. Her classes are both energizing and relaxing with 
thoughtful instructions that allow her students to take the lessons that they learn in her yoga 
classes and bring them into their daily lives. 
				</p>
				<p>
Each class will create an experience that includes: 
					<ul>
					  <li>User-friendly yoga, with adaptations offered for all skill levels and abilities 
					  <li>Pranayama (breathing techniques) to calm the nervous system and steady the mind  
					  <li>A sample of meditation as part of every class (loving kindness, body awareness, breath awareness)  
					  <li>A final pose of deep relaxation
					</ul>
				</p>
